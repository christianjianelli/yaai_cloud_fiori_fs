# yaai_cloud - ABAP AI tools Cloud - Freestyle SAPUI5 Application

This App is an example of how to integrate ABAP AI tool Cloud capabilities into Freestyle SAPUI5 Applications.

The current focus of this documentation is detailing the integration of a simple chat user interface into a Freestyle SAPUI5 Applications.

Because SAPUI5 does not include dedicated controls to build a chat interface, a custom solution is required. This documentation provides the necessary steps for implementing this custom chat UI within your Freestyle SAPUI5 application.

## Overview of Chat Integration

The custom chat solution is built using several key components:

*   **Chat.js**: A module that contains all the core chat functionality.
*   **chat.css**: The custom CSS file that defines the chat styles.
*   **marked.umd.js**: The necessary markdown parser used to parse the markdown content generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The integration steps documented herein guide you through adding this functionality, including:

1.  Adding a **Controller Extension** to the List Report (e.g., `ListReportControllerExt.controller.js`).
2.  Adding a **Custom Action** to trigger the chat interface.
3.  Uploading and linking the custom files (`Chat.js` and `chat.css`).
4.  Adding the **Chat.js module** dependency.
5.  Calling the **`Chat.onToggleChat()`** function from the custom action event handler.
6.  Setting up context retrieval functionality (e.g., `getAppContext`) within the controller extension to provide the chat with necessary data, such as `Travel ID`, `Description`, and customer details.
7.  Initializing the chat by calling **`Chat.setContextProvider()`** and **`Chat.setChatHTMLContent()`** in the `onAfterRendering` hook.
